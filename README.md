## Summary
Capstone project for Thinkful. NousFood app is intended to help equip more people with a better understanding of the potential benefits of brain-boosting foods and supplements. In addition, this app hopes to empower those already engaged and experimenting with "nootropics" by providing a platform where you can:
* 'Follow' nootropics and curate a news feed to  
* 'Create' and manage custom stacks
* 'Connect' with the community. Save, Fork, and Share nootropic stacks

Backend supported by [NousFood API](https://github.com/Quanda/nousfood-api)

## Motivation
A recent area of interest of mine lately has been trying to learn more about how different food compounds affect our brains through their influence on neurotransmitters. More specifically in cases where cognition, focus, and/or attention have shown to be positively impacted. The timing of this new intrigue and of having to decide on what to build for my Thinkful capstone lent me an opportunity for the taking. To tackle both at once - together.
