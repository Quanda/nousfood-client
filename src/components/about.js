                </header><br/>
                <h3>noh-É™-TROP-iks:</h3>
                <p><i>nootropic</i>: from the Greek words 'nous' - meaning mind, and 'trepein' meaning to bend or turn.</p><br/>

                <p>The word nootropic was coined in 1972 by a Romanian psychologist and chemist,
                Corneliu E. Giurgea, who synthesized Piracetam in 1964.</p><br/>

                <p>According to Dr. Giurgea, a substance categorized as a nootropic meets the following criteria:</p>
                <ul className="italic bold">
                    <li>A nootropic may enhance learning and memory.</li>
                    <li>A nootropic may help protect the brain from disruptive conditions such as hypoxia (low oxygen) or electroconvulsive shock.</li>
                    <li>A nootropic may help protect the brain from various chemical or physical injuries such as the effects of barbiturates and anti-cholinergic substances.</li>
                    <li>A nootropic may increase the efficacy of cortical and subcortical neuronal firing mechanisms.</li>
                    <li>A nootropic must possess few or no side effects with very low toxicity.</li>
                </ul><br/>

                </header><br/>
                <p>As research continues, our scientific understanding of these compounds continues to solidify and expand.
                    It's really all about the functioning of the brain at a neuro chemical level, and suffice to say any substance could 
                    be called a nootropic if it grants the user more control over their neurochemistry and the resulting behavioural and experiential outcomes</p>

                </header><br/>
                <p>The term stack in this context, refers to the compounding of nootropics in effort to gain 
                synergistic cognitive enhancing effects</p>
